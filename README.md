# employee-management-system

This is a basic CLI used to track and maintain an employee workforce. This app tracks
departments, roles, and employees. It allows the user to view and add to each table
and uses mysql2 to store that data.

To start install dependencies, and use either `node index.js` or `npm start`

App can be started using either `npm start` or with `node index.js`.

Once started, use arrow keys to navigate menu, space to select a function,
and enter to confirm that selection.

##### Important:
If you **do not** select anything, or select **more than one** option on the main menu, 
the app will simply exit the current loop and *close the app*. 

Simply restart the program if needed.

### Roadmap
Future updates for this app:
- Add the ability to delete information from the DB
- Add budgeting capablities, salary totaling, spending limits, etc.
- More employee sorting capablities (ex. by manager or department)
